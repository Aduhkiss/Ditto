## How the Permissions System Works

## Support Ticket System

## Why we built this system?
I didn't like the lack of customization when it came to choosing who was able to run certain commands on my discord 
server with certain bots, so I designed this system to allow server admins to specify who can run what command, along with
when they are able to run those commands.
